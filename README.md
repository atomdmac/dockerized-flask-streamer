# Dockerized Flask Streamer
Files for generating a dockerized video streaming server written in Python.  It includes OpenCV for better WebCam support.

# Prior Art
This repo essentially just combines some stuff that other smart people made:
- [Flask Steaming Video Server](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-video-streaming)
- [spmallick's OpenCV Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/spmallick/opencv-docker/)

# Future Improvements
- Including OpenCV seems like overkill... can we support webcams without the bloat?
